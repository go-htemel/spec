# Spec

This package defines all the primitive types used in by the htemel generators.

## Usage

This package was split out of the `go-htemel/htemel` package in an effort to reduce the footprint of the original package.
The generator/parser code for creating specs is a little gnarly but suffices for now.

### Install

```text
go get github.com/go-htemel/spec
```

## Warning

This package should not be directly used.
